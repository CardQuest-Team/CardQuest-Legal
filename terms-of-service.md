# CardQuest – Terms of Service
**Effective Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Last Updated:** November 15, 2025  

Welcome to **CardQuest** (“the Bot”), a Discord application developed to provide an interactive collectible card experience and the **Lorepoly** board game within Discord servers.  
By using the Bot, you agree to the following Terms of Service (“Terms”).

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By adding or using CardQuest in a Discord server, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).  
If you do not agree, please remove the Bot and discontinue its use.

---

## 2. Eligibility
You must:

- Be at least 13 years old, or the minimum age required to use Discord in your region; and  
- Use the Bot in compliance with all applicable laws and Discord’s policies.  

Server owners are responsible for ensuring their members meet these requirements.

---

## 3. Use of the Bot
CardQuest includes two main features:

- A **collectible card system** (cards, points, leaderboards, profiles), and  
- **Lorepoly**, a fast-paced 1v1 digital board game (matches, stats, leaderboards).  

You agree **not to:**

- Abuse, exploit, or spam the Bot’s commands, interactions, or APIs  
- Attempt to disrupt or damage the Bot’s operation or servers  
- Use the Bot for illegal, hateful, or exploitative purposes  
- Manipulate leaderboards or match results (for example, by win-trading, intentional disconnect abuse, or other unfair behavior)  
- Reverse-engineer, copy, or distribute the Bot’s source code or data  

We reserve the right to restrict or terminate access to the Bot at any time if these Terms are violated.

---

## 4. Data Collection and Usage
CardQuest collects minimal information required for functionality, such as:

- **User IDs** (to save collections, points, and Lorepoly match data)  
- **Server and channel IDs** (to manage settings like spawn channels and Lorepoly-enabled channels)  
- **Message content** only when related to bot commands or interactions  
  (e.g., slash commands, button presses, and select menus for card collecting or Lorepoly)  
- **Gameplay data**, including:
  - Card collection progress and points  
  - Lorepoly match statistics (such as wins/losses, number of games played, and other basic board game stats shown on profiles and leaderboards)  

This data is used only to operate and improve CardQuest. It is **not sold, shared, or used for advertising**.  
See our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) for detailed information on data handling.

---

## 5. Intellectual Property
All original content, including:

- Bot code  
- Card images and artwork  
- Lorepoly board, tokens, icons, and related visual assets  

is the property of the CardQuest development team and/or the credited artist(s).

Users retain ownership of their own Discord content and usernames.  

---

## 6. Availability and Support
We strive to maintain uptime, but do not guarantee uninterrupted service.  
This includes:

- Card spawns and collection features  
- Lorepoly matchmaking, games, and leaderboards  

Features may change, be temporarily disabled, or be discontinued at any time without notice.

---

## 7. Gameplay and Fair Use
By using CardQuest and Lorepoly, you understand that:

- Matches can end due to timeouts, disconnections, or in-game mechanics  
- Game outcomes (such as losses by timeout or bankruptcy) are final from the Bot’s perspective  
- Exploiting bugs, automation, or scripting to gain unfair advantages is prohibited  

We may reset match results, points, or other data if abuse or exploitation is detected.

---

## 8. Termination
We may suspend or permanently ban users or servers that:

- Violate these Terms or Discord policies, or  
- Attempt to exploit bugs, abuse the Bot, or misuse data.  

We may also remove Lorepoly access or card-spawn functionality from specific servers or channels when necessary.

---

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties
CardQuest is provided **“as is”** without any warranties, express or implied.  

We do not guarantee:

- That the Bot will be available at all times  
- That all features will work without errors  
- That gameplay balance or outcomes will meet user expectations  

Use of the Bot is at your own risk.

---

## 10. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of the Bot, including but not limited to:

- Loss of in-bot progress, cards, points, or Lorepoly match records  
- Inaccurate leaderboard positions  
- Downtime or removal of the Bot from servers  

Your use of CardQuest and Lorepoly is at your own risk.

---

## 11. Changes to Terms
We may revise these Terms from time to time.  
The latest version will always be available through our official ToS location.  
Continued use of the Bot after changes are published constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

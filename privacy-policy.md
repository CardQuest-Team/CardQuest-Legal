## 1. Information We Collect
CardQuest only collects limited data necessary to operate:
- **User IDs:** To identify user collections and scores  
- **Server IDs:** To store settings such as spawn channels or admin preferences  
- **Message content:** Only the text used in bot commands (e.g., “collect [card name]”)

## 3. Data Storage and Security
- Data is stored securely in a private database accessible only to the CardQuest development team.

- If the Bot is removed from a server, related server data may be automatically deleted after a grace period.

# CardQuest – Privacy Policy  
**Effective Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Last Updated:** November 16, 2025  

This Privacy Policy explains how **CardQuest** (“we,” “our,” or “the Bot”) collects, uses, and protects user information for both the **card collection system** and the **Lorepoly board game**.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

CardQuest only collects limited data necessary to operate:

- **User IDs:** To identify player accounts, collections, and game progress  
- **Server IDs:** To store settings such as spawn channels, Lorepoly enable/disable status, or admin preferences  
- **Message content:** Only the text used in bot commands and interactions (e.g., `/collect`, `/binder`, `/lorepoly`, etc.)  
- **Timestamps:** For debugging, scheduling spawns, and enforcing turn timers  
- **Gameplay data:**  
  - Card collection data (which cards you own, points, rarity)  
  - Lorepoly match data (wins/losses, ongoing games, and basic board state tied to your user ID)

We do **not** collect names, emails, IP addresses, or any sensitive personal data.

---

## 2. How We Use the Data

Collected data is used solely to:

- Provide gameplay functionality, including:  
  - Card collection, binders, and leaderboards  
  - Lorepoly matches, game state, and win tracking  
- Improve bot performance and fix bugs  
- Prevent abuse, spam, and exploitative behavior

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- Data is stored securely in a private database accessible only to the CardQuest development team.  
- Reasonable security measures (such as credential restriction and encrypted connections) are applied.  
- If the Bot is removed from a server, related server-specific data (such as spawn settings and Lorepoly enable state) may be automatically deleted after a grace period.

---

## 4. Data Retention

User and server data are kept only as long as needed for functionality. For example:

- Card collections and points are kept so long as your account remains active.  
- Lorepoly match data and game state are kept only as needed for gameplay, statistics, and leaderboards.

Inactive data may be deleted after 90 days or upon request.

---

## 5. User Control and Data Requests

Users can request data deletion or access by contacting:  
📧 **cardquestdev@outlook.com**  
💬 Discord: **@tigiyku**

Requests will be reviewed and handled within a reasonable timeframe.  
Note: Deleting your data will also remove your card collection, points, and Lorepoly match history.

---

## 6. Third-Party Services

CardQuest runs entirely on the Discord platform and follows [Discord’s Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).  
We do not use third-party analytics or advertising integrations.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

CardQuest is intended for users aged **13 and older**, in line with Discord’s policy.  
We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time.  
Changes will be reflected by updating the “Last Updated” date above.  
Continued use of the Bot after changes means you accept the new policy.
